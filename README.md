# 📊 Stock Price Prediction Project
## This colab notebook contains the plotly graphs so using the colab might be a good idea otherwise there will be no plotly graphs on the notebook above.
This project utilizes deep learning techniques (LSTM/Transformers) to predict stock prices based on historical data. The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab for easy access and execution.

## 🚀 Run the Notebook in Google Colab

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict stock prices using historical market data of McDonald's.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, Plotly, Scikit-learn.
- **Data Source:** Historical stock price data from alpha vantage.
- **Model Used:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) .
- **How Data used:** dataset contains five columns("Open","High","Low","Close","Volume" ).So for training model took 30 days data of all column and predicted the 31st day's "Close" value.
Note : If the notebook is accessed through colab kink then the output will be "Open","High","Low","Close" values instead of only "Close".
