## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict stock prices using historical market data of McDonald's.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, Plotly, Scikit-learn.
- **Data Source:** Historical stock price data from alpha vantage.
- **Model Used:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) .
- **How Data used:** dataset contains five columns("Open","High","Low","Close","Volume" ).So for training model took 30 days data of all column and predicted the 31st day's "Close" value.
