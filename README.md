# 📊 Stock Price Prediction Project
## This colab notebook contains the plotly graphs so using the colab might be a good idea otherwise there will be no plotly graphs on the notebook above.
This project utilizes deep learning techniques (LSTM/Transformers) to predict stock prices based on historical data. The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab for easy access and execution.

## 🚀 Run the Notebook in Google Colab
